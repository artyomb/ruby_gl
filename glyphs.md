# Stargate the ancients' language
I'm a big fan of the Stargate series! I was thinking about the unordinary symbols of the ancients' language. 

I found their form to have a bit-like structure. So I started with a randomly generated pattern NxN.

Then I found some patterns don't look _good_. So, I added check functions to exclude these patterns.

- **no_quads?**
    Exclude 'bold' structures.

- **no_chess?** Exclude 'chess' structures.

The script generates new glyphs on each key press. Press 's' to take the screenshot.

An extended alphabet of the ancients' language!
