# Stargate the ancients' language
I'm a big fun of Stargate series! I was thinking about the unodinary symbols
of the ancients' language. 

I found there form to have bit-like structure. So I started with random generated pattern NxN.

Then I found that some patterns doesn't look _good_. 
So, I added check functions to exclude these patterns.

- **no_quads?**
    Exclude 'bold' structures.

- **no_chess?** Exclude 'chess' structures.

The script generates new glyphs on each key press. Press 's' to take the screenshot.

An extended alphabet of the ancients' language!
